<h1>Considerations</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The stocks are equally-weighted in the portfolio. Originally, the SPX differs the weight of each stock by the company's Market Cap.</li>
  <li>The API I used was the sandbox version, so the data may not represent the company's real data</li>
  <li>The development of this algorithm was inspired by: Algorithmic Trading with Python - freecodecamp.org</li>
</ul>
